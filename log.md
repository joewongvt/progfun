	* change - struggled with problem definition, went down the road of trying to enumerate nCk and working with each combination, which did not address the possibility of repeated coins. As an aside, I should look more at [these algorithms](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/127704/algorithm-to-return-all-combinations-of-k-elements-from-n)
	* Ironically I was quite nearly at the solution with my initial draft but did not think of the right way to bisect the recursive tree.  The forums pointed to SICP, which clarified the approach
