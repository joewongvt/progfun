#### 4/24

* 21:45-23:20:
	* Intro video
	* Tools setup for OSX
	* Install scala 2.11.0
	* Install sbt 0.13.2
	* Install idea scala plugin
	* setup initial project
	* import example project
	* sbt working correctly
* 00:30-01:11
	* sum/max recursive solutions, submit
	* learned about styleCheck

#### 4/30

* 19:15-21:20:
	* Week 1 videos, Martin's OSCON youtube video

#### 5/1

* 21:45-22:00:
	* Download/sbt setup week 1 assignment

#### 5/2

* 00:00-00:30
	* Pascal's triangle
* 15:30-17:30
	* Matching parens
	* Start change
	* Study/review session with Jordan
* 21:00-12:00
	* change - struggled with problem definition, went down the road of trying to enumerate nCk and working with each combination, which did not address the possibility of repeated coins. As an aside, I should look more at [these algorithms](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/127704/algorithm-to-return-all-combinations-of-k-elements-from-n)
	* Ironically I was quite nearly at the solution with my initial draft but did not think of the right way to bisect the recursive tree.  The forums pointed to SICP, which clarified the approach

#### 5/10
* 00:00-01:00
	* Video lectures 2.1-2.4 (HOF, Currying, Fixed Points, Scala Syntax)
* 20:50-23:35
	* Assignment 2.1
	* Assignment 2.2

#### 5/15
* 22:00-23:15
	* Video lectures 2.5-2.7 (Functions & Data, More Fun with Rationals, Evaluation & Operators)

#### 5/18
* 23:00 - 04:00
	* Assignment 3 
		- struggled with inefficient implementation of moreRetweetsThan, waffled between calculating leastRetweets and mostRetweets by not considering placing the recursive call directly in the 2nd argument of Cons()
		- used try/catch for control flow, inefficient

#### 5/19
* 12:00 - 13:00
	* Clean up assignment 3 for git checkin
	* Video lectures (I really should have watched these earlier)
